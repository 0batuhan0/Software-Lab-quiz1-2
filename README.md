# Software Lab quiz 1-2

*Quiz 1 and Quiz 2 .py files are inside the folders.

*In Quiz 1, 3 series (arithmatic, geometric, fibonacci) were created with for and while loops.

*You can wander through these series as much as you want without closing the program.


*6 different sorting algorithms are used in Quiz 2 and how long these algorithms work is printed.

*You can sort a randomly created list among these sorting algorithm as many times as you want without closing the program.

*The fastest of these algorithms was 'heap' and the slowest was 'selection'. Below are the running times from the list created with the same number of elements:
